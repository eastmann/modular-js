# Modular JS

## Some ground rules:

- Self-contained module
  - No global variable
  - Everything to do with my module is in my module
  - If a module manages more than one thing, it should be split up
- Separation of concerns
- DRY code
- Efficient DOM usage
  - Very few $(selections)
- No memory leaks
  - All events can be unbound
